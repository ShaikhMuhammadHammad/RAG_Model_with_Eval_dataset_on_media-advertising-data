A similar trend can be expected by these categories in 2023.\n     \u2022    ARY Digital is projected to be the top-rated channel, just like previous years, followed by HUM TV and GEO TV.\n\n     \u2022    Ramazan sees a shift in behaviour trends as religion jumps to the forefront of searches, followed by food and\n          popular TV shows & programs.\n     \u2022    YouTube is the most popular medium, followed by Facebook.\n     \u2022    According to consumer reports, 67% of Pakistanis will choose to spend more time using mobile devices,\n          followed by spending time on online platform (57%) and Messenger apps (52%), while 38% will choose to\n          spend time watching TV in Ramazan 2023.\n5\n     \u2022    Most shoppers start preparing & shopping for Ramazan 2 weeks in advance, yet the hype begins much earlier\n          and lasts throughout the period.\n     \u2022    Apparel, Beauty & Personal, Food & Groceries, Travel & Tourism experience an increase in search queries\n          during different weeks of Ramazan.\n     \u2022    There is also an increase in the recipe search trends indicating that people will try out new recipes in Sehri\n          and Iftar for their families while at home.\n     \u2022    Groceries show an erratic pattern in search trends, as most families in Pakistan buy in bulk because of\n          Ramazan bazaars.",

As a result, viewership share will disperse towards Entertainment and News genres.",

TV AdEx is also projected to increase by 5-6% compared to Ramazan 2022. Given these numbers, we can foresee\nthat Ramazan 2023 will be a ripe opportunity for advertisers.",

This\n can help in increasing USD inflow to Pakistan in future.\n Due to import bans and unavailability of international\n alternatives, local manufacturing brands and local publishers\n are ripe for development, since consumers will shift their\n preferences based on supply.\nSource: WorldBank, Tradingeconomics, SBP, Business Recorder, PKRevenue\n           Since Current\n           Account Deficit\n           is decreasing\nsince start of FY22-23,\nany     advertisers      who\nmaintain or grow their\nad     spending       during\nthis period might see\nan increase in sales\nand market share due\nto market supply and\ndemand dynamics that\nwill favor ad buyers",
